## About Me
<h3> My background in computational and lab-based biochemistry allowed me to develop my analytical problem-solving skills, as well as to expand my creativity by designing my own projects. My love for computers and coding brought me on the Web Development path, and I cannot wait to embark and grow in my new career as a web developer.</h3>

<p>A game designed for children, written in JavaScript and jQuery, inspired by the 70s game "Simon Says". The User plays against the computer, or farm animals in this case. The farm animals will play a sequence of sounds, which increase in complexity after each round. The User then has to imitate these sounds by pressing on the corresponding animal.</p>

<p>The technologies used to build this project are: JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Heroku.</p>

<!--
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) is a simple way of including Tex/LaTex/MathML based mathematics in HTML webpages. To get up and running you need to include the MathJax script in the header of your github pages page, and then write some maths. For LaTex, there are two delimiters you need to know about, one for block or displayed mathematics `\[ ... \]`, and the other for inline mathematics `\( ... \)`.

## Usage

To enable MathJax support be sure Kramdown is your Markdown flavor of choice and MathJax is set to true in your `_config.yml` file.

~~~
markdown: kramdown
mathjax: true
~~~

~~~
Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering:
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
~~~

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering:
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

The only thing to look out for is the escaping of the backslash when using markdown, so the delimiters become `\\[ ... \\]` and `\\( ... \\)` for inline and block maths respectively.

  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}

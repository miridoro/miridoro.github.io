<h3> A one-week group project. An altruistic social media MEAN-Stack App that lets Users post To-Do tasks for others. Based on the theory of giving without expecting a commercial return. My role consisted of mainly back-end coding, including setting up the basic skeleton of a a fully authenticated App, in addition to coding many of the controller functions.</h3>

<h3>This project was built with JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, Bootstrap, Express, MongoDB, bcrypt, Bower Task Manager, CSS animation, AngularJS and Node.js </h3>
